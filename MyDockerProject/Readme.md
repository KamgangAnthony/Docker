
This Dockerfile builds a Docker image based on the Python Alpine 3.8 image. It copies the current directory to the /app directory in the Docker image, sets the working directory to /app, installs the requirements listed in the requirements.txt file, exposes port 5000, and sets the command to run the index.py file using Python.

# Usage

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:


`docker build -t <image-name> .`

Replace <image-name> with the name you want to give the Docker image.

<br>
To run the Docker container using the image that was built, use the following command:


`docker run -p 5000:5000 <image-name>`

This will map port 5000 from the container to port 5000 on your local machine. Replace <image-name> with the name of the Docker image you built in the previous step.

# File structure

The Dockerfile assumes that the current directory contains the necessary files and directories for the application to run. Specifically, it assumes that the requirements.txt file is present and contains the necessary Python packages for the application.

<br>
The file structure should look something like this:

/app
    
index.py
    
requirements.txt
